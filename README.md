# Therapeutic Gold

Finally, be able to drink your piles of money for sustenance!

This mod makes gold of all forms heal you when picked up. I find it a more preferable alternative to passive regeneration or rare health boxes. The default setting of this mod heals you for 4 hp per 10 gold collected, and this value does scale with larger or smaller amounts as well. There is a configurable healing scalar in the config file for QOL.

Of course this mod can be abused when used in combination with "Midas Suite."

I have yet to find any compatibility issues with other mods.
