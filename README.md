# Therapeutic Gold

Finally, be able to drink your piles of money for sustenance!

This mod makes gold of all forms heal you when picked up. I find it a more preferable alternative to passive regeneration or rare health boxes. The default setting of this mod heals you for 0.4 hp per gold collected, scaling with pickup amount for chunks. The healing scalar value is configurable from the Mod Config menu in-game for those who want more or less of a challenge in their run.

I understand, and fully expect gold spells to be overpowered when this plugin is used in combination with "Midas Suite".

I have yet to find any compatibility issues with other mods, please let me know if you find any!
